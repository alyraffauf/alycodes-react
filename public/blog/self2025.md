I'll be speaking at [Southeast LinuxFest](http://www.southeastlinuxfest.org/) 2025 on June 14th, 2025 at the Sheraton Airport Hotel in Charlotte NC! I'm on at 5PM in the 45 Drives - JR Ballroom.

My talk is titled _Stop Breaking Things: A Gentle Introduction to NixOS in the Homelab_. We'll be covering Nix, Flakes, and how to build more resilient infrastructure in Nix. Here's the official abstract:

> Does your home lab feel too fragile to touch? Are you feeling a little burnt out? Join me for a gentle introduction into NixOS in the home lab. We'll talk about declarative package management, reproducible builds, self-documenting infrastructure as code, and how to never break your Plex server again.

SELF is free to attend, so come join us! To follow along, find my slides at [self2025.aly.codes](https://self2025.aly.codes/).
